conda activate venv/
streamlit run app.py  

1. conda create -p venv python==3.11 -y (to create environment)
    Here is a breakdown of each component:
    conda create: This is the main command that instructs Conda to build a new environment.
    -p venv:
    The -p (or --prefix) flag specifies the exact path where the new environment should be created, rather than using the default Conda environments directory.
    In this case, venv refers to a folder named venv in your current working directory. You can replace venv with any path you prefer (e.g., C:\projects\myenv or ./myenv).
    python==3.11:
    This specifies the package and version to install in the new environment.
    It tells Conda to install the Python interpreter version exactly 3.11 (e.g., Python 3.11.x).
    -y:
    This flag (short for --yes) automatically proceeds with the installation without prompting for a manual "y" confirmation when Conda lists the packages to be installed. 


2. from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split:
    The purpose of the sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split function is to divide a dataset into two distinct subsets: a training set and a testing set. 
    This is a crucial step in machine learning for ensuring the model is evaluated on unseen data, which provides an unbiased assessment of its performance and ability to generalize to real-world scenarios.
    
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
        X, y, 
        test_size=0.2, 
        random_state=42,
        stratify=y)

3.Example of a manual split:
    import pandas as pd

    df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

    train_size = int(0.8 * len(df))
    train = df.iloc[:train_size]
    test = df.iloc[train_size:]

    This works, but notice the hidden problems:

    ❌ If your data is sorted (time, label, difficulty, etc.),
    your train and test will be biased
    ❌ No randomization
    ❌ No control over reproducibility
    ❌ No stratification (class balance can break)
    ❌ Easy to mismatch X and y
    ❌ You may accidentally leak information


    Manual splitting is useful when:
    👉Time series data (you should not shuffle)
    train = df[:'2024-01-01']
    test = df['2024-01-02':]
    👉Special business rules
    Example:
    Train on customers from region A, test on region B (Sklearn can’t infer this logic.)
